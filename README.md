# 💱 Currency Converter

The Currency Converter is a web-based application designed to help users convert an amount from one currency to another in real time. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface where users can input a value, select source and target currencies, and instantly get the converted result.

This project is particularly useful for travelers, international businesses, and developers learning how to work with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript.

<h4>🧠 Key Concepts Covered</h4>
API Integration (Real-time exchange rates)

Asynchronous JavaScript (fetch/async-await)

DOM Manipulation

Event Handling

Responsive Design

<h4>🔧 How It Works</h4>
The user enters an amount and selects the base and target currencies.

On button click or input change, the app sends a request to a free exchange rate API (like ExchangeRate-API or exchangerate.host).

The API returns the latest exchange rate.

The result is calculated and displayed dynamically.

<h4>💻 Technologies Used</h4>
HTML5 – For page structure and input forms

CSS3 – For styling and responsiveness

JavaScript (ES6+) – To fetch data from API and handle logic

REST API – To get real-time currency exchange rates

<h4>🎯 Features</h4>
